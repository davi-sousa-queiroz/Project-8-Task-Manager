🗓️ Project 8 – Task Manager (February 28th 2026)

A simple terminal-based Task Manager built in Python.

This project focuses on clean structure and practicing core fundamentals like:
	
  •	Functions
	•	Loops
	•	Lists
	•	enumerate()
	•	Removing items by index
	•	Basic error handling

💡 Features
	
  •	View current tasks
	•	Add new tasks
	•	Remove completed tasks by selecting their number
	•	Runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit

Tasks are stored in a list and displayed with numbered indexing using enumerate().
Completed tasks are removed using .pop() with the correct index adjustment.

🧠 Purpose

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of:
	
  •	Breaking programs into multiple functions
	•	Passing data between functions
	•	Managing user input
	•	Structuring a small but complete CLI application

It’s simple, but structured and scalable.

🚀 Future Improvements

Possible upgrades:
	
  •	Due dates
	•	Persistent file saving
	•	Sorting tasks
	•	Improved validation
	•	A more advanced version as a larger project
